\label{sec:methods_subjects}
Male mice (PND 30-60) served as subjects. The mice were single-housed in a colony room with a reverse 12:12 hr light cycle (dark 7 AM to 7 PM). Two strains of mice were trained and tested: C57BL/6 (C57) and an outbred strain on mixed background (MEK) with deficiencies in the MEK2 gene, implicated in ERK/MAP kinase signaling cascade. The MEK2 deficient mice were acquired for initial experiment piloting, and the mutation has no known behavioral or health effects, nor were any observed, presumably due to compensation by the closely related kinase MEK1 \cite{12832465}. Both strains of mice were acquired from an in-house breeding program. All mice were water restricted, beginning seven days prior to the experiment. During water restriction, each mouse received 1 mL of water in their home cage at 4:30 pm each day, in addition to any liquid they earned in the experimental session. Experimental sessions occurred between 9 AM and 4 PM, seven days a week. 
All mice were handled in accordance guidelines established with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, and the experimental procedures were approved by the Arizona State University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
