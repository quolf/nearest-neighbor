\begin{itemize}
\item Generalization frequently shown across carbon chain lengths across multiple species [human, dog, elephant, mouse, rat]
\item Monomolecular odorants rarely exist in the natural environment
\item Mice easily discriminate among odorants of many functional groups that vary only by a single carbon (Laska and Hommen 2007).
\end{itemize}
