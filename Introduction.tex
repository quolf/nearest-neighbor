\section{Introduction}

--Generalization frequently shown across carbon chain lengths across multiple species [human, dog, elephant, mouse, rat]
--Monomolecular odorants rarely exist in the natural environment
--Mice easily discriminate among odorants of many functional groups that vary only by a single carbon (Laska and Hommen 2007).
