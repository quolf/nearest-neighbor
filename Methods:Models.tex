\subsection*{Models}
\label{sec:methods_models}

We modeled the data by considering only the carbon chain length of the molecules composing each stimulus.  
We considered 3 classes of models, varying in computational complexity.  
\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{Scalar}: Each stimulus was represented by the mean carbon chain length of its components.    


\item Fit details
\item Goodness of fit statistics
\item Equations for all models
\item References to code
\end{itemize}
