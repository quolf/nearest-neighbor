\subsection*{Models}
\label{sec:methods_models}

We modeled the data by considering only the carbon chain length of the molecules composing each stimulus.  
We considered 3 classes of models, varying in computational complexity.  
\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{Scalar}: Each stimulus was represented by the mean carbon chain length of its components.  The probability of response ($p_r$) was a function of the difference between the mean carbon chain length of the $S+$ and that of the test stimulus.  
\item \textit{All-to-All}: Each stimulus was represented by an array of the carbon chain lengths of the components, e.g. an array of length 2 for a binary mixture. $p_r$ was a function of the difference between each element of the $S+$ array and each element of the test stimulus array, i.e. the difference in carbon chain lengths between each $S+$ component and each test stimulus component.  
\item \texit{Nearest Neighbor}: Each stimulus was represented as in \textit{All-to-All}, but $p_r$ was a function only of the difference between each element of the $S+$ array and the single nearest (most similar in carbon chain length) element of the test stimulus array.  
\end{itemize}

In each model class above, the computation in each stimulus comparison was given by: 
\begin{equation}
f(S+_i) * g(S+_i,test_j)
\end{equation}
with each function argument the carobn chain length of an $S+$ component $i$ or a test stimulus component $j$, where:
\begin{equation}
f(x_i) = exp(-a*x_i)
g(x_i,x_j) = exp(-b*|x_i-x_j|)
\end{equation}
