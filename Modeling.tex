\subsection*{Data pooling}
\label{results_pooling}
The first three experiments were replicated in two strains of mice (\ref{sec:methods}). 
The identify of the $S^+$ was varied across replications.  
Observing similar results across strains and $S^+$ identities (Figure \ref{fig:results}), we pooled the data such that one component of the $S^+$ was designated as the reference component, and all other components in the $S^+$ or the test stimuli were labeled according to the difference in carbon chain length among their components relative to the reference (Figure \ref{fig:model_fits}, dashed lines).  
For example, for a $S^+$ consisting of 2-heptanol and 2-octanol, we designated 2-heptanol as the reference, $0$, and 2-octanol as $+1$.  
Together the $S^+$ could be labeled $(0,+1)$.  
A test stimulus of 2-octanol and 2-nonanol is then labeled $(+1,+2)$.  
This allowed us to present data from experiments using different $S+$ identities together on the same plot (Figure \ref{fig:model_fits}).
