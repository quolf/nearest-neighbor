In the first experiment (``Single''; Table {tab:design}i), the $S^+$ and the test stimuli were monomolecular odorants, not mixtures. Therefore, this experiment tested the direct physiochemical (molecular) similarity between the $S+$ and each of the test stimuli (G1-G3). Test stimuli had carbon chain lengths varying from 2 shorter to 2 longer than the $S^+$.  
The results (Fig. \ref{fig:results}a) indicated that generalization responses decrease with increasing carbon chain length difference between the $S+$ and the test stimuli, as reported previously for both mammals and insects \cite{18810459}\cite{24488965}.  

In the second experiment (``Double''; Table {tab:design}ii), the $S^+$ and the test stimuli were binary mixtures, with each mixture containing molecules adjacent to each other in carbon chain length.  
Each test stimulus was ``shifted'' from the $S^+$ such that both components shifted together by the same degree of carbon chain length.  
Generalization to the test stimuli occurred as a function of the degree of overlap of the mixtures with the S+. However, the generalization gradient was shallower than in experiment 1 (Fig. \ref{fig:results}b). The test stimuli that contained one component in common with the S+ elicited higher responses than the test stimuli closest to the S+ in experiment 1. Generalization in the C57 line was asymmetric, with strong responses to the test stimulus that constained components shifted to shorter chain lengths. 

In the third experiment (``1-Shared''; Table {tab:design}iii), the $S^+$ and the test stimuli were binary mixtures that differed in exactly one component, with the remaining component (2-heptanol) in common.  
The component that differed across mixtures varied systematically in carbon chain length.  
In this experiment, generalization was almost totally flat (Fig. \ref{fig:results}c), indicating that the identity of the differing component was almost irrelevant.  
The animals appeared to focus on the common component.  

In the fourth experiment (``1-Distant''; Table \ref{tab:design}iv), the two components of the test stimuli had no overlap with the $S^+$, but each component was either 1 carbon shorter or 1 carbon longer than one of the components of the $S^+$.  
Only a low level of generalization was observed (Fig. \ref{fig:results}d), and it was similar to the generalization observed in experiment 1.  

In the fifth experiment (``Vapor Pressure Control'') the test stimuli were identical to the $S^+$ (2-heptanol), except they all varied in concentration.  
Alcohols of lower molecular weight tend to have higher vapor pressures (approximately 3-fold decrease with each additional methyl group).  
Therefore, in experiments 1-4 generalization could have been driven primarily by similarity to the vapor pressure of the $S^+$.  
We therefore performed an experiment to control for vapor pressure by using a single odorant (2-heptanol) for the $S^+$ and all test stimuli; the test stimuli then differed from the $S+$ only in concentration.  
We found that response rate was approximately linear in concentration, with no deviation reflecting a specific preference for the concentration of the $S^+$.  
This indicated that vapor pressure was not the principal quality that drove generalization responses in experiments 1-4.
