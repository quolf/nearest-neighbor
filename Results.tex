In order to understand how perceptual similarity is determined across mixtures, we conducted five olfactory generalization experiments with binary mixtures of straight-chain aliphatic alcohols.  
In each experiment, we trained mice to associate a single mixture ($S^+$) with liquid reward and then tested their conditioned responses during exposure to the $S^+$ or to related mixtures (\ref{sec:methods}).  
Across experiments, the relationship between the $S+$ test stimuli was varied to determine what features of the $S^+$ were most effectively generalized during testing.  

In the first experiment (``Single''), the $S^+$ and the test stimuli were not mixtures, but single components; since there is no overlap whatsoever between stimuli (i.e. no shared components), only direct physiochemical similarity to the $S^+$ varies across the test stimuli.  
These test stimuli had carbon chain lengths varying from 2 shorter to 2 longer than the $S^+$.  
The generalization we observed (Fig. \ref{fig:results}a) indicated that similarity decreases with increasing carbon chain length difference between the S+ and the test stimuli, as reported previously \cite{18810459}\cite{24488965}.  

In the second experiment (``Double''), the $S^+$ and the test stimuli were binary mixtures, with each mixture containing molecules adjacent in carbon chain length.  
Each test stimulus was ``shifted'' from the $S^+$ similar to experiment 1, except with both components shifted together.  
Generalization similar to, but shallower than, experiment 1 was observed (Fig. \ref{fig:results}b).  

In the third experiment (``1-Shared''), the $S^+$ and the test stimuli were binary mixtures differing in exactly one component, with one component in common.  
The differing component varied systematically in carbon chain length.  
In this experiment, generalization was almost totally flat (Fig. \ref{fig:results}c), indicating that the identity of the differing component was almost irrelevant.  

In the fourth experiment (``1-Distant''), the test stimuli had no overlap with the $S^+$, but each component was either 1 carbon shorter or 1 carbon longer than a corresponding component in the $S^+$.  Only a low level of generalization was observed (Fig. \ref{fig:results}d), similar to experiment 1.  

In the fifth experiment (``Vapor Pressure Control'') the test stimuli were identical to the $S^+$, except they all varied in concentration.  
Since alcohols of lower molecular weight tend to have higher vapor pressures (approximately 3-fold decrease with each additional methyl group), we wanted to ensure that generalization was not driven solely by similarity to the vapor pressure of the $S^+$, but rather to some other perceptual quality.  
We used a single odorant (2-heptanol) for the $S^+$ and all test stimuli, and varied only concentration.  
We found that response rate was approximately linear in concentration, with no deviation reflecting a specific preference for the concentration of the $S^+$.  
This indicated that vapor pressure was not the principal variable to which responses were generalized.
