Experimental design. In each experiment type (A-E), each row correspond to one stimulus, with the $S+$ identified, and the three test stimuli (a-c) also listed.  For each stimulus, the molecular components are given along the row.  Each number corresponds to the carbon chain length $n$ of one component, with all components being secondary straight-chain alcohols.  For example, a stimulus with only a "7" refers to 2-heptanol, while one with "7" and "8" refers to a binary mixture of 2-heptanol and 2-octanol. All odorants were diluted to $0.1\%$ in mineral oil, except in the vapor pressure control (experiment E); in that experiment the stimulus is always 2-heptanol, with the dilution (schematized by font size) changing across stimuli.
