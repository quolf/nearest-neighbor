Mean-squared error for each model fit. Models were fit to the data using either a fixed baseline response probability, or one that was allowed to vary across experiment types.  In both cases the 'Nearest Neighbor' model yielded the best fit, despite being simpler (few component-wise comparisons) than the 'All to All' model.
