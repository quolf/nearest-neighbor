Mean-squared error for each model fit. Models were fit to the data using either a fixed baseline response probability, or one that was allowed to vary across experiment types.  In both cases the \textit{Nearest-Neighbor} model yielded the best fit, despite being simpler (few component-wise comparisons) than the \textit{All-to-All} model.
