\subsubsection*{Generalization testing}
\label{sec:methods_training}
During generalization testing, the probability that a subject would respond to each three generalization odorants ($G1$, $G2$, and $G3$) relative to the $S+$ was tested. Generalization testing consisted of ``warm up'' block, as per odorant discrimination, and four generalization blocks. Generalization blocks consisted of eight trials â€“ two trials with each generalization odorant ($G1$, $G2$, and $G3$), and two trials with the $S+$. Responding to the generalization odorants was never reinforced. However, to prevent response extinction, responding on one of the two $S+$ trials in each block was reinforced, while the other was not. In generalization blocks, trial order was determined pseudorandomly, in that all four types of trials ($S+$, $G1$, $G2$, and $G3$) must have occurred before a second trial of the same type occurred.
