\subsection{Modeling}
\label{sec:results_modeling}
To quantitatively account for the generalization observed in each of the five experiments, we considered three potential means for computing the perceptual similarity of mixtues, and fit a model for each.  We considered several possible candidate models, differing in how and which components are involved in the computation of similarity (Figure \ref{fig:cartoon}):
