\subsection{Modeling}
\label{sec:results_modeling}
To account for the shape of the generalization gradients in each experiment, we developed a series of models that could be uniformly applied to each data set in order to account for  the similarity and overlap of the component odorant mixtures  To capture the data, a candidate model needs to reflect that component similarity is predictive of generalization, and that component overlap may be a special case of perfect similarity.  

We considered several possible candidate models (Figure X):
