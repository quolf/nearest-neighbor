\subsubsection*{Apparatus}
\label{sec:methods_apparatus}
Experiments were conducted in a ``Slotnick-style'' 4-channel pinch-valve olfactometer (described in \cite{18428626}) and operant chamber purchased from Knosys Systems. All odorants were diluted to $0.1\%$ in mineral oil (Sigma-Aldrich #M3516-1L), except as noted in the text and described in the Experiments section below.

Experimental events were controlled and recorded by software custom written in Python. The reinforcer was approximately 0.006 mL of chocolate milk (Shamrock Farms; Phoenix, AZ) diluted in water ($\frac{1}{3}$ milk by volume) combined with the sounding of a brief (0.3 s) 9 kHz buzzing tone at 65 dB from a set of stereo computer speakers. Subjects were given approximately 0.5 mL of the milk mixture 24 hours prior to the first experimental session to familiarize them with the reward they would experience in behavioral experiments.
