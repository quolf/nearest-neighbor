\label{sec:methods_procedure}
The odorant discrimination training and generalization testing protocol was a modified version of the Go/No Go task used by Slotnick and colleagues \cite{18428626}. Each experiment consisted of four phases: Pre-training, Odorant discrimination (full reinforcement), Odorant discrimination (partial reinforcement), and Generalization Testing.
