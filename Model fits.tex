\subsection*{Model fits}
We fit the three models to the data from the 5 experiments, holding all parameters constant (for each model) across the experiment fits.  
To quantify the fit we calculated the mean square error by ...
This resulted in good fits to 4 of the 5 experiments. 
The exception was in the 1-Shared experiment, where response probability was overestimated by every model, presumably due to the low average response probability in that experiment.  
Next, we fit the models holding all parameters except baseline response rate constant (differences in baseline rate reflect differences in acquisition of the $S^+$, or possibly motivation). 
We obtained excellent fits to the data from the 5 experiments (Fig. \ref{fig:model_fits}).  
While the the \textit{Mean} model showed the poorest fit, the \textit{All-to-All} and \textit{Nearest-Neighbor} models fit the data well, with the latter yielding the lowest mean squared error (Fig. \ref{fig:mses}).
